## 🚀 Task Overviews
Each task folder is a self-contained project. Below is a brief summary of each, including its purpose, the technologies used, and how to run it.

### 📝 Task 1: Student Score Prediction
Description: This project involves building a linear regression model to predict student exam scores based on their study hours. The process includes data cleaning, basic visualization, and model performance evaluation.

Key Skills: Data Cleaning, Linear Regression, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Bonus: Explored polynomial regression to compare performance and experimented with different feature combinations.


### 📝 Task 2: Customer Segmentation
Description: The goal of this task was to cluster customers into segments based on their income and spending score. It involves data scaling, visual exploration, and applying K-Means clustering to find the optimal number of groups.

Key Skills: K-Means Clustering, Unsupervised Learning, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Bonus: Compared different clustering algorithms like DBSCAN and analyzed the average spending per cluster.


### 📝 Task 3: Forest Cover Type Classification
Description: This project focuses on predicting the type of forest cover using multi-class classification models. The process includes data preprocessing, handling categorical features, and visualizing model performance using a confusion matrix and feature importance plots.

Key Skills: Multi-class Classification, Tree-based Models, Scikit-learn, XGBoost.

Bonus: Compared different models (e.g., Random Forest vs. XGBoost) and performed hyperparameter tuning.


### 📝 Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction
Description: This task involves building a model to predict whether a loan application will be approved. Key steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and evaluating the model on imbalanced data, with a focus on precision, recall, and F1-score.

Key Skills: Binary Classification, Imbalanced Data, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

Bonus: Used SMOTE to address class imbalance and compared the performance of logistic regression against decision tree models.


### 📝 Task 8: Traffic Sign Recognition
Description: This task involves building a deep learning model to classify traffic signs from images. The process includes image preprocessing (resizing, normalization) and training a CNN to recognize different traffic sign classes.

Key Skills: Computer Vision (CNN), Deep Learning, Keras, TensorFlow, OpenCV.

Bonus: Added data augmentation to improve performance and compared a custom CNN with a pre-trained model like MobileNet.
